                    Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen,
                    blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw motto 
                    was <b>"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure."</b>

                <p>Hufflepuff was founded by a medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard
                    work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. Hufflepuff's emblematic animal was a 
                    badger. Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen:yellow 
                    represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology,
                    owing their correspondence to earth.

                    Slytherin's love to be in charge and crave leadership, hence their motto <em>"Do What is Necessary."</em>
